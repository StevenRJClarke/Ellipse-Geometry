## About

An educational application allows you to draw an ellipse by clicking-and-dragging the mouse.

The geometry of the ellipse is shown to the user; the semi-major and semi-minor axes, the major and minor axes and the area.

Alternatively, the user can enter sufficient dimensions for the ellipse and the application will calculate the others. Sufficient dimensions are:

* <u>both</u> the lengths of the semi-major <u>and</u> semi-minor axes

* <u>both</u> the lengths of the major <u>and</u> minor axes

## Installation and Getting Started
