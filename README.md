## About

An educational application allows you to draw an ellipse by clicking-and-dragging the mouse.

The geometry of the ellipse is shown to the user; the semi-major and semi-minor axes, the major and minor axes and the area.

Alternatively, the user can enter sufficient dimensions for the ellipse and the application will calculate the others. Sufficient dimensions are:

* both the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes

* both the lengths of the major and minor axes

## Installation and Getting Started
